        <p>Hundreds of people walked past or under the mural portraying Edward Said while heading to class or entering the bookstore.</p>

        <p> A second-year Palestinian student recalled looking at the Edward Said Mural almost everyday while walking around the 
            SF State campus. They remembered the contemplative gaze of the Palestinian academic portrayed in front of a background
            weaving a depiction of SF State’s Malcolm X plaza with iconic landmarks from New York City, Jerusalem and San Francisco. 
            Two cloud-like doves stand out in the bright blue sky, their intertwined figures spelling the word for “peace” in Arabic. </p>

        <p> “Something that brings me a lot of joy as a Palestinian on campus is the mural,” the student said, speaking on 
            the condition of anonymity. “Every time I see it, it just makes me happy that there’s something that’s a part of us 
            that is visible on campus.”</p>

        <p> The mural, which celebrates Palestinian heritage and commemorates the late writer, academic and human rights activist 
            Said, was completed in 2007 — after almost three years of objections, leading to an eventual redesign. It joined 
            multiple murals on campus that display students’ backgrounds and leaders such as Malcolm X and Cesar Chavez, illustrating 
            the history and efforts of various social justice movements.</p>

        <p> “The reason I chose SF State was more about, ‘I like it here’ and ‘I like that there’s like the one and only [General 
            Union of Palestine Students] that’s left here,’” said another Palestinian student who spoke on the condition on 
            anonymity. “I like that there’s a Palestinian mural. It kind of just makes it feel like I’m meant to be here.”</p>

        <p>For other Palestinian students, SF State’s history of student activism and social justice was a reason to attend the university.</p>

        <p>Although these students value aspects of the university that celebrate their identity, such as the mural of Said, this 
            feeling of acceptance often fades when students hear about and experience attacks from pro-Israel organizations. Students 
            have said that this sense of vulnerability has been exacerbated by a lack of support — and at times, vilification — from administrators.</p>
            
        <p>For many students, the potential consequences of expressing weigh heavily against their freedom to express their identity and advocate for justice in and for Palestine.</p>

        <p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again. But why, some say,
            the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>

        <p> We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because
            that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>

        <p> It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency.</p>

        <p> In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful
            as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined,
            will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.</p>
